# Orion RSH Server

- In development
- Python remote command execution server

# Do not use for corporate environments

- Still needs to be tested for possible vulnerabilities
- Does not have a custom config file with configurations (Although this is in store for update 2.3)
- Each update newer supported configs will be added. Each config, its functions, and its options can be read in the documentation

# Usage

- You will need a TCP client to connect to the server with port specification like:
  `nc localhost 8080`

- You must run `server.py` as root or with sudo permissions as it gets hashes from /etc/shadow (it uses setuid after authentication, root access is not given by default)
- After server is running, have your client connect to the same port

- To be determined
- Most likely more customizable configurations and shell features
