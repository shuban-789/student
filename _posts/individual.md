# N@TM Reflection - A comprehensive analysis üåç

- What went well

- What could be improved upon

- Common feedback

- Plans for CPT

- Other values gained by other teams

## What went well üóº

At N@TM, all of the procedures went smoothly as planned. All of the features that we had planned for were working and a lot of people came by to check out our website. Some good techniques we had employed was a really cool homepage with aesthetics such as an RGB outline which people could spot from faraway. This attracted a lot of people to check out our project.

The like button was a huge hit among participants and so was the post hierarchy. It becaem a sort of post it board for the entire Night at the Museum. Our use of the other features such as the delete and the edit features also brung many to awe as there were questions about our backend which we proudly answered with our vast collection of knowledge.

As a team I think we did fine and indivudally I think I contriubted a lot to explaining to people how they backend works.

## What we could have improved on

For the purpose of CPT, our project needed a more direct purpose. The purpose was the main issue we had going into the project. We found out that we needed an actual purpose to fulfill and instead of looking at that we started to focus way more on fucntionality. This was good as it helped us move forward for our night at the museum endeavors, but for actual CPT it might be more helpful to actually have a goal in mind. I think some edits which might need to be made to make this an actual good CPT project is a target audience. Maybe the corporate world or just plain consumers. The consumer must be in mind in order to find a goal or purpose.

## Common feedback

Here are some common feedback I got about the project as I conversed with those who attended the event:

- Maybe try adding a Direct Message option

- Try adding a way to post images and videos

- Try adding an embed system

- Make replies more visible

- Try adding threads to make replying more streamlined

- Maybe add buitlin features the user could use for more interaction like built-in survey mode

## Plans for CPT

There are two plans I have for CPT. Plan 1 is to build off on this current CPT project and add all of the features I am thinking of. On top of that, the feedback features could also be added. Although the drawback of this is that part of whther I really want to present a web design project to College Board like everyone or not?

If the entire Del Norte is submitting a server wit flask backend as a part of CPT, I need to make something which deviates me form others. Something which can get me a 5. So I can do this by these 3 ideas:


### 1. Extend Bluejay CPT üê¶üêß

Possible Features:

- Image upload

- DMs

- Video upload

- Refined purpose

### 2. Extending Orion RSH (my personal project form trimester 1) and adding some more features ‚úàÔ∏èüåç

Possible Features:

- PAM support

- More configurations

- More support for plugins (will naturally help with security granting possible use for corporate benefit)

- Taylor per rubric

### Plan for CollegeBoard MCQ üìÉ

- Research more on my own away from web development related subjects

- Refine my coding skills in terms of knowledge

### Orion RSH plan üöÄ

- Implement PAM support

- Try to maybe use skills from web development to create a distinct UI

- Make better configurations and parsing

### My CPT contributions

For my team, I deployed our backend, I made the MessageAPI feature, and the Like feature. I also did more things, but htese were my key commits. OVerall, I feel like I have acted as a satisfactory Backend operator.

My contributions are documented in the video above.
