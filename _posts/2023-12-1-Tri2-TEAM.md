### Bandwidth Question
In the context of Computers, Bandwidth is basically the speed of information retrieval. It is sometimes confused with internet speed which is measured by ping or latency. But latency, which is measured in ms is the time it takes to retrieve OR download data. So a low ping is higher speed.

### Computer Network Question
The main difference between LAN and WAN is that they are used in different settings. WAN would be something running for a whole area or the network web on a grander scheme. So something like a cell tower. Anything providing network access on a wider range is WAN. While LAN would be like home Wifi. One example of why LAN would be used is maybe in an esports tournament. The participants will probably compete on LAN because all of them are there in person and it might be faster to do so, or even more convenient than WAN. It is important though in such network settings we enable SSL and secure cryptographic algorithms because if a hacker intercepts a conversation between clients and servers it could cause a security breach. The computer network structure can be a whole intricate web of switches and routers each distributing network access to servers and desktops.

### Packet Switching
The journey of a packet can be really big depending on the structure of the network. Networks are highly customizable and some structures can be easy and familiar as others are complex. A good tool to simulate network structure is Cisco Packet Tracer. One such example could be a chat server or IRC in which a user sends the server a message and the server relays that message, sent in a packet to another user.

### Fault Tolerance Assignment: Make two data flowcharts like the examples above, you can use MS paint, canva, any design website. Make one Fault Tolerant and one not fault tolerant, and explain what needs to be changed to the flowchart in order to make the network fault tolerant. Doing these will get you over a .90:
- [x] Neat design, easy to understand
- [x] Real network examples; don't label each point as A-B-C etc.

### Parallel Programming Assignment: 
- [x] First make a simple code that runs sequentially, for example loops ten times before stopping.
- [x] Then make code that completes the same job quicker by running parallel.

### Parallel and Distributed Computing
Sequenced code:
```py
password = str(input("Enter your 4 digit PIN: "))
test = ""
for a in range(0,10):
  for b in range(0,10):
    for c in range(0,10):
      for d in range(0,10):
        test += str(a)
        test += str(b)
        test += str(c)
        test += str(d)

        if "".join(test) == password:
          print("Password Cracked! Your password is: " + password)
          break
        if test != password:
          test = ""
```
Same sequenced code but with Parallel Computing:
```py
import concurrent.futures

def check_password(test, password):
    if test == password:
        print("Password Cracked! Your password is: " + password)
def crack_password(password):
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        futures = []
        for a in range(0, 10):
            for b in range(0, 10):
                for c in range(0, 10):
                    for d in range(0, 10):
                        test = str(a) + str(b) + str(c) + str(d)
                        future = executor.submit(check_password, test, password)
                        futures.append(future)
        concurrent.futures.wait(futures, return_when=concurrent.futures.FIRST_COMPLETED)
password = input("Enter your 4 digit PIN: ")
crack_password(password)
```

### Bonus Hack (0.05 pts): Self Reflect on your use of technology? Whats your daily screen time? What beneficial effects of technology do you utilize and what are some negative consequences you succumb to?

### ANSWER: 
My daily screen time is about 6 hours on my computer, but 2 hours on my phone. I use my computer more than I use my phone. Some beneficial effects of this are that I need these devices to submit housework, code, and reach information. I am relayed information at a fast rate and a lot of tools and resources are at my fingertips. Such examples of these resources could be Google search for information, the time module on my computer for keeping track of time, and the internet for online communication or reaching important websites. One big negative consequence is distraction. By being on the device itself I am risking the chance of there being distracted from my goal for an elongated amount of time.

### Question 1: Choose an innovation(Social media, computers, phones, etc.) and talk about an alternative use than what its actually use for. Then, give the potential positive and negative impacts of the use you came up with

### ANSWER:
The innovation I will be talking about is the computer. In specific, the personal computer which is referred to as a PC which can come in the form of a laptop or a desktop. This is an invention of high computing power and processing power. It reels its components such as the CPU, GPU, RAM, SSD, altogether to function properly and perform tasks with effectiveness and efficiency. We use it for entertainment in things like gaming, requiring fast processing, productive things like meetings or school work which can be done because the computer is able to connect to the internet. Although it is not used for this, one alternative thing this personal computer could be used for is a File Transfer Protocol server. This task is usually done by special server computers made to be constantly running. But the personal computer could be hosting a server. 

Pros: The server will run like any other FTP server. The goal of distributing files will be achieved easily
Cons: This will require the computer to be on constantly. Something that a personal computer does not usually do.

### Question 2: How might you as a programmer implement code that helps your program have less unintended risks.

Unintended risks can be minimized by being noticed. If as a programmer we can notice some of the flaws in our work ahead of time, we can add features that could minimize those social issues or maybe remove a feature that may be really destructive

### HW Hack 1: How has the digital divide been bettered/worsened by recent national or global events? How may the digital divide get worse in the future without intervention?

### ANSWER:

Digital divide has been a problem on the forefront of technology since the huge technological boom in computational devices. Those who have access to these machines known as computers know how to operate them, and those who don't can't learn due to no tangible computer. Having access to technology can even give one more answers than another who may not have access at all. This creates a divide in opportunities as individuals may not have access to the internet or have enough money to pay for it. Something that we are doing to better the digital divide is making the internet more accessable everywhere with cell towers covering a larger radius. We are also increasing connectivity and support in all communities to close the gap. On top of that, service is being more affordable. 

But digital divide could also get worse due to the rise of technology asking for high performance hardware specifications like AI and Machine Learning development which may change computer science as we know it. Such specifications could be a GPU for faster multivariable calculations.

If digital divide is on the increase in the future many groups could get locked out of a large portion of jobs. This is a bg deal since in the future, basically most jobs will need knowledge of how to operate a computer to do.

### HW Hack 2: Give some examples of how individuals, organizations, and the government can all help lessen the digital divide.

### ANSWER:

EveryoneOn - Helps connect low-income families to the internet with affordable internet plans

human-I-T - Helps people gain access to physical hardware to connect to the internet

Mobile Citizen - Provides low cost internet access to educational organizations or non-profits

# 5️⃣ Team Teach Homework 5 (Prakruti, Vidha, Isabelle, Hannah)

[Team 5 Raw Link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isabellehp/tri2/main/_notebooks/2023-12-12-Computing-Bias.ipynb)

### Question 1: Define "computer bias" in your own words and explain how it can result from intentional or unintentional factors in software development. Give a brief example of this. Explain how programmers can actively work to reduce bias in their algorithms?

### ANSWER: 

Computer bias is basically any bias to a certain result or group by computers and computer algorithms. Many of these algorithmic flaws are logic or values which are unknowingly set by the developer. An example of this is if a data set for training a large learning model is only containign orange colored cats in a dataset of animals. The model might associate cat with the color orange, so when presented with a white cat it may lead to complications.

### Question 2: Briefly describe the two types of bias in software development and provide examples from the gaming industry and social media platforms. How might biases in software design affect user engagement and experiences?

### ANSWER:

In terms of the gaming industry a type of bias could be a character model for a playable character only having one kind of look. This look can be traced to the target demographic. In the scenario of social media, it could be how depending on location some social medias will change the lnaugage they are in.

# 7️⃣ Team Teach Homework 7 (Anthony, Rayane, Chris, Aiden, Ethan)

### Question 1: Explain the concept of crowdsourcing. Provide examples of how it is commonly used in different fields.

### ANSWER:

Crowdsourcing is the act of obtaining information via a large mass of people and their services. This is usually used in relation to the internet. Some examples of crowdsourcing could be the urban dictionary or Wikipedia. Both of these sources are free to edit by anyone on the internet and thus anyone on the internet can provide their services and edit these pages and update their information. These tasks are really small usually though. Like in polls, getting votes would be crowdsourcing technically.

### Question 2: Discuss the benefits and challenges associated with crowdsourcing. How can organizations effectively harness the power of crowdsourcing while mitigating potential drawbacks?

### ANSWER:

The thing with crowdsourcing is that the benefits of it are things like speed and the fact that you are getting information from a diverse collection of people or voices. Because so many people are contributing to one collection of information, the information provided can be of different viewpoints or lenses.

However, one drawback with crowdsourcing is the fact that you are unable to control the motives of the people contributing which could possibly sabotage your information collection.

### Question 3: Identify a real-world example of a successful crowdsourcing project. Explain the project, its goals, and the positive outcomes achieved through the collaboration of a large group of people.

### ANSWER:

One real world example are Wikipedia and multiple wikis. The goal of the wikipedia project was to create a sort of encyclopedia on the internet. But of course, the creators of Wikipedia were just coders. They did not know everything about the world. But they thought maybe everyone new everythign about the world at this moment collectively. So they made Wikipedia open for editing to the whole internet. Of course this editing was the first kind of managed editing and was not any sort of editing of source code or site functionality.

### Question 4: Create a hypothetical scenario where crowdsourcing could be applied to solve a specific problem. Describe the problem, the type of contributions you would seek from the crowd, and the potential impact of implementing the crowdsourced solution.

### ANSWER:

Hypothetically, a problem that would require the expertise and esperiences of several people could be tackled with crowdsourcing. Such a problem could be if there was a huge test which tested you on everything humans know about the world. You could do crowdsourcing to get help on it.

    print("AP Calculus: " + apcalc)
    print("AP CSP: " + apcsp)
    print("AP Chemistry: " + apchem)
    print("Spanish 1: " + span1)
steve = grades("Steve")
bob = grades("Bob")
alice = grades("Alice")
carmichael = grades("Carmichael")
steve.gradebook("Steve","A+","A+","A+","A+","F")
