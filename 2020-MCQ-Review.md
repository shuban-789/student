## Score

In terms of the score, I got a **58 out of 67** on the MC this time. So granted I get a 6/6 on the Create Performance Task for the AP exam, I would get a 5 on the exam. My score has seen an improvement compared to last time though and I feel like knowledge I have collected from team teaches have helped boost my score. But I feel like it is **not good enough** and I need to set time aside to make sure I am scoring perfect score on these types of problems.

## Strengths and Weaknesses

Strengths:
- Robot MCQ
- Cybersecurity
- Algorithms
- "What does this program do"
- Cryptography

Weaknesses:
- Simulations
- Ethical concerns
- Internet ethics
- Not reading the question fully

## What's next

I feel like out of all of my weaknesses simulations is the one that hurt me the most. I missed either two or 3 simulation problems. Here were the two problems I missed for simulations. To practice I can:

- Go over simulations team teach
- Look for simulation practice problems online
- Maybe make some personal projects addressing this

## How I got my Strengths

Cryptography/Cybersecurity:
For Cryptography I did a project last trimester and was the lead in terms of encryption development. I learned a lot about how strings or messages are obfuscated and manipulated.

I am a part of CyberAegis, our school's CyberPatriot team and I teach Linux. I know it to a level that most people do not. I also know about exploits in code and attack vectors.

Algorithms/Robot MCQ/"What does this program do":

A combination of a bunch of ACSL practice problems, and competing in computing Olympiads

## Building a Practice Routine

I think for my practice routine it is best that I find every saturday to do simulation problems and maybe periodically attempt more practice MCQs so that I can see if I am approaching my goal of full scoring or not

## What I improved on from last time

- More algorithm questions were correct
- Since there were more team teaches I got more questions correct for those

## Summary

Although I have improved from last time, there is a long way to go until I fullscore the MCQ. But I believe there is enough time to do it.
